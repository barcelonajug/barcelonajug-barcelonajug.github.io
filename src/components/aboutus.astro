        We're a group of geeks from the condal city who want to share
        experiences and knowledge related to the IT world and this programming
        language
        that brings us so many laughs and heartaches ðŸ˜…

        We talk, debate and also organize workshops to practice and put to the
        test new technologies.
        In the end, we share experiences related to the IT world, especially
        with Java,
        but not only with this language.

        If you like to discuss, share, ask questions, or just have a good time,
        we're open to your suggestions.
